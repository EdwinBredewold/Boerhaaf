Hi there, nice that you made it this far.        
I hope you will try and finish this exercise.    
At the end of it, this file should contain all the names of our 'class'.       
The file must be forked onto your own account.           
If you've forked it, add another name of one of our group members, and save it.          
Each new name starts at a new line.           
Than send the email 'Github-Chainletter' to the one whose name you added, disclosing the name of your GH-account.               
The last one in the chain thinks of something else to add, (maybe tell a joke?).              
It should be a great way to check if everything works, and to get some gitpractice.        
After completing this, it should be no problem at all to pass the test.        
Edwin.         
Anton-Jan.
