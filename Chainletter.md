A repository is called after a famous scientist from Leiden.   
In it, there is a file that, in the end, should contain all the names of our 'class'.   
The file must be forked onto your repository.      
If you've forked it, add another name, and send an email to the next member, containing the name of your GH-account.       
Each new name starts at a new line.     
The last one in the chain thinks of something funny (no pressure).         
It should be a great way to check if everything works, and to get some gitpractice.    
After completing this, it should be no problem at all to pass the test.
