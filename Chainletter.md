Hi there, nice that you made it this far.        
I hope you will try and finish this team-exercise.     
At the end of it, this file should contain all the names of our 'class'.       
The file must be forked onto your own account.           
If you've forked it, add 1 name of one of our group members, and save it to your own repository.              
Each new name must start at a new line.              
Than send the email 'Github-Chainletter' to the one whose name you added, disclosing the name of your GH-account.               
The last one in the chain thinks of something else to add, (maybe tell a joke?).              
It should be a great way to check if everything works, and to get some gitpractice.        
After completing this, it should be no problem at all to pass the test.        
Edwin.         
Anton-Jan.
