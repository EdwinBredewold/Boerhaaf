Make a repository called 'Boerhaaf'
In it, there is a file that, in the end, should contain all the names of our 'class'.
The file is forked onto your repository
If you get it, add your name, and fork it to the next member.
The last one in the chain thinks of something funny (no pressure)
It should be a great way to check if everything works, and to get some gitpractice.
